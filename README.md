# MLx + Interface?
Powerful tool with Powerful framework.

## What is the interesting features?  
- *Engineer data with our UI*: Drag-and-drop columns, Property panel, most common charts, features importance, choose algorithms, .... The repeat actions in notebook will be presented in the new way on UI, just click.
- *Every engineering data step via UI will be recorded*, so we don't need to pass the almost-featured-dataframe to MLx, just pass the raw data.
### Not just a framework, it's a studio.
